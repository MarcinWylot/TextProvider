The TextProvider serves individual lines from a static text file to 

clients over the network. The client-server protocol for this system is

the following:



    GET <n>  => If <n> is a valid line number for the

             text file, you should return "OK\r\n" followed by the <n>th

             line from the text file.



             If <n> is NOT a valid line number, you should return

             "ERR\r\n".



             Note that the lines in the file should be indexed starting from 1,

             not 0.



    QUIT     => This command should disconnect the client.



    SHUTDOWN => This command should shutdown the server.
